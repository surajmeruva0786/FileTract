# FileTract — Project Changelog & Development Guide

> **Rule:** Every change, progress update, and feature addition must be logged here **before** committing. Commit code + this file together, then push immediately.

## Project Overview

**FileTract** is a patent-pending AI document intelligence system. It extracts structured fields from scanned documents (PDFs, images) using a 5-stage confidence-weighted OCR pipeline powered by Tesseract OCR and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash.

**Repository:** https://github.com/surajmeruva0786/FileTract  
**Patent Status:** Pending  
**Backend:** Flask API on Render.com

## Changelog

### 2026-06-29 — Mobile App Added (React Native / Expo)

**What changed:**
- Created `filetract_mobile/` — a full React Native (Expo) mobile application
- App supports: camera capture or gallery upload of ID cards, user-defined field extraction, live preview of extracted data, and one-tap export to Google Sheets via Apps Script Web App
- Created `filetract_mobile/google_apps_script/Code.gs` — Google Apps Script template for Sheets integration
- Updated `README.md` with mobile app setup instructions

**Why:** Results from the existing pipeline needed improvement for mobile ID card scanning use case. Mobile-first approach allows users to directly photograph ID cards (Aadhaar, etc.) and extract to Google Sheets.

**Files added/changed:**
- `filetract_mobile/` (entire new directory — React Native Expo app)
- `CLAUDE.md` (this file — created)
- `README.md` (updated with mobile app section)

---

### Previous Changes (from git history)

- **Optimize Patent Pipeline** — Added timeout handling, fallback to standard pipeline, limit re-OCR to 50 regions
- **Critical Fix** — Remove hardcoded Windows Tesseract path from adaptive_reocr_engine (fixes Docker/Patent Pipeline)
- **Fix LLM Hallucinations** — Remove example data, add strict anti-hallucination instructions
- **Docker Detection** — Explicit Docker detection for Tesseract path (force Linux path in containers)
- **Tesseract Path Fix** — Use `tesseract` command for Linux instead of full Windows path

---

## Development Rules

1. **Every change → update this CLAUDE.md first**
2. **Commit code + CLAUDE.md together** (same commit)
3. **Push immediately after commit** — no batching
4. **Documentation changes** (README, etc.) also committed and pushed with code

## Known Issues / Next Steps

- Patent pipeline results quality needs improvement for real-world degraded documents
- Mobile app backend URL needs to be configured to point to deployed Render.com instance
- Google Sheets integration requires user to deploy their own Apps Script Web App
